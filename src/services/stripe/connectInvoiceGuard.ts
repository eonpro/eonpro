/**
 * Connect-invoice auto-create guard
 * ==================================
 *
 * Decides whether `StripeInvoiceService.updateFromWebhook` should auto-create
 * a local `Invoice` row for a Stripe-Connect invoice (e.g. WellMedR).
 *
 * Background (2026-04-22 regression fix):
 * A prior blanket-skip on Connect invoices (introduced 2026-04-19 to prevent
 * duplicate creation at initial checkout) also suppressed recurring renewals,
 * which are NOT owned by any external automation. Renewals never reached the
 * patient profile or provider Rx queue → missed prescription dates.
 *
 * Ownership model for Connect (WellMedR):
 *   • `subscription_create` / `manual` → owned by Airtable automation
 *     (`/api/webhooks/wellmedr-invoice`). Skip auto-create to avoid duplicates.
 *   • `subscription_cycle` / `subscription_update` / `subscription_threshold`
 *     → no external automation fires. MUST auto-create here.
 *   • Unknown / null billing_reason → ambiguous; skip (conservative).
 *   • Non-paid statuses → skip (only reconcile successful charges).
 *
 * This predicate is a pure function to keep the critical-path branch trivially
 * testable and to prevent a silent regression from recurring.
